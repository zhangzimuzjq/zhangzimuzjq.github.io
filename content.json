By The Apache Software Foundation What Is It?Apache JMeter can measure performance and load test static and dynamic web applications. It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers,network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types. FeaturesComplete portability and 100% Java. Multi-threading allows concurrent sampling by many threads andsimultaneous sampling of different functions by separate thread groups. ProtocolsAbility to load and performance test many applications&#x2F;server&#x2F;protocol types: Web - HTTP, HTTPS (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET,…) SOAP &#x2F; REST Webservices FTP Database via JDBC LDAP Message-oriented Middleware (MOM) via JMS Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S) Native commands or shell scripts TCP Java Objects IDEFully featured Test IDE that allows fast Test Plan recording (from Browsers or native applications), building and debugging. Command LineCommand-line mode (Non GUI &#x2F; headless mode)to load test from any Java compatible OS (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, …) ReportingA complete and ready to present dynamic HTML report Live reportinginto 3rd party databases like InfluxDB or Graphite CorrelationEasy correlation through ability to extract data from most popular response formats,HTML,JSON,XML orany textual format Highly Extensible Core Pluggable Samplers allow unlimited testing capabilities. Scriptable Samplers (JSR223-compatible languages like Groovy). Several load statistics can be chosen with pluggable tiers. Data analysis and visualization plugins allow great extensibility and personalization. Functions can be used to provide dynamic input to a test or provide data manipulation. Easy Continuous Integration via 3rd party Open Source libraries for Maven, Gradle and Jenkins. The Latest VersionDetails of the latest version can be found on theJMeter Apache Project web site RequirementsThe following requirements exist for running Apache JMeter: Java Interpreter: A fully compliant Java 8 Runtime Environment is requiredfor Apache JMeter to execute. A JDK with keytool utility is better suitedfor Recording HTTPS websites. Optional jars: Some jars are not included with JMeter.If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory JDBC - available from the database supplier JMS - available from the JMS provider Bouncy Castle -only needed for SMIME Assertion Java Compiler (OPTIONAL): A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes aprecompiled Java binary archive. Note that a compiler is required to build plugins for Apache JMeter. Installation Instructions Note that spaces in directory names can cause problems. Release builds Unpack the binary archive into a suitable directory structure. Running JMeter Change to the bin directory Run the jmeter (Un*x) or jmeter.bat (Windows) file. WindowsFor Windows, there are also some other scripts which you can drag-and-dropa JMX file onto: jmeter-n.cmd - runs the file as a non-GUI test jmeter-n-r.cmd - runs the file as a non-GUI remote (client-server) test jmeter-t.cmd - loads the file ready to run it as a GUI test DocumentationThe documentation available as of the date of this release isalso included, in HTML format, in the printable_docs directory,and it may be browsed starting from the file called index.html. Reporting a bug&#x2F;enhancementSee Issue Tracking. Build instructionsRelease buildsUnpack the source archive into a suitable directory structure.Most of the 3rd party library files can be extracted from the binary archiveby unpacking it into the same directory structure. Any optional jars (see above) should be placed in lib/opt and&#x2F;or lib. Jars in lib/opt will be used for building JMeter and running the unit tests,but won’t be used at run-time. This is useful for testing what happens if the optional jars are notdownloaded by other JMeter users. If you are behind a proxy, you can set a few build properties in~/.gradle/gradle.properties for Gradle to use the proxy: 12345678systemProp.http.proxyHost=proxy.example.invalidsystemProp.http.proxyPort=8080systemProp.http.proxyUser=your_user_namesystemProp.http.proxyPassword=your_passwordsystemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy.example.invalidsystemProp.https.proxyPort=8080systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_user_namesystemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_password Test buildsJMeter is built using Gradle. The following command builds and tests JMeter: 1./gradlew build If the system does not have a GUI display then: 1./gradlew build -Djava.awt.headless=true The output artifacts (jars, reports) are placed in the build folder.For instance, binary artifacts can be found under src/dist/build/distributions. The following command would compile the application and enable you to run jmeterfrom the bin directory. Note that it completely refreshes lib/ contents,so it would remove custom plugins should you have them installed. 1./gradlew createDist Alternatively, you could get Gradle to start the GUI: 1./gradlew runGui Developer InformationBuilding and contributing is explained in details atbuilding JMeterand CONTRIBUTING.md. More information on the tasks available forbuilding JMeter with Gradle is available in gradle.md.
